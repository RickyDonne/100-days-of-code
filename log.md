# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December, 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Planned everything for the next year.

**Thoughts:** 

I will cover these topics in the next 100 days: 

1. Data Structures and Algorithms (Coding part and problem solving)
2. System Design
3. Operating System and DBMS (database management system)
4. Object-Oriented Design
5. Cultural Fit

I have also joined the Odin Project to build my foundation in Web Development.

And I have made a target to solve almost 400 - 500 coding problems on codechef or leetcode.

### Day 1: January, 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of singly linked list in C & started reading The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I learned to implement adding & deleting nodes at the 
start, end, nth position & also reverse them using iteration & recursion
in a singly linked list.
Read about robot tour optimization and selecting the right jobs.

Code: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/SinglyLinkedlist.c


### Day 2: January, 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Wrote the code for a singly linked list without looking anything up and implemented a way to not take head as a global variable

Singly Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/SinglyLinkedlist-referenceHead.c

Learned about 

Doubly Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/DoublyLinkedList.c

and 

Circular Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/circularLinkedList.c

**Thoughts:** 
I learned and understood the concepts of doubly and circular linked list and implemented adding, deleting, reversal and traversal of nodes.
It's getting hard to find resources of DS in C language since most are in C++, Java and I am thinking of learning C++.
Books such as Algo design by Skiena and CLRS are good but not DS focused.


### Day 3: January, 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Learned a bit of C++ from GeeksforGeeks.Link to CPP: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/fork-cpp/ . 

Did my first coding problem on SPOJ. Attended a quiz CDSE hosted by WebDevsIn and got 13 correct out of 20. Practiced Implementation of SLL, DLL and CLL.

**Thoughts:** 
I could not complete my implementation of CLL. I will try it again tommorow.

My practice Repo: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice/tree/main


### Day 4: January, 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Completed Introduction to C++, Flow Control, Functions, Arrays and strings.
Range based loops were interesting and new to me.
An example: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice/blob/main/arrayincpp.cpp

Solved 2 problems in Codechef using C.

**Thoughts:** 
I need to focus a bit more in C and C++. Before going in depth in DSA. I will be spending few more days with C and C++ before commiting my entire time to DSA. 


### Day 5: January, 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Revised some of the theory concepts of C from a course on Udemy. Solved one problem in codewars. 
Practiced implementaion of CLL.

My code on CLL: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice/blob/main/CLL.c

**Thoughts:** 
Doing an actual C course from Udemy helped me get more clear picture of few concepts. I will need few more days to complete the course.


### Day 6: January, 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Revised few theory concepts of C on arrays, functions and character strings.
Created a tic tac toe game using C code.
Code of Tic tac toe: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C .
Practiced implementation of SLL, CLL and DLL.

**Thoughts:** 
It was fun to make the tictactoe game. I also revised the concepts of arrays and strings in C. I think i might be able to start proper learning of
DSA in 2-3 days.


### Day 7: January, 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Completed learning about the theory concepts of C from a udemy course. Learned a lot about pointers, structures and file IO concepts and implemented them.

A code on structures: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/Arrays%20and%20pointers/structuresInC.c

**Thoughts:** 
It was great to learn the theory but now I should start practicing them and start problem solving.


### Day 8: January, 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved around 39 C programs starting from the basic.

Problems: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice

**Thoughts:** 
I would need another day to complete soving basic problems. I would move to proper coding websites after that.



### Day 9: January, 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Practiced 34 C programs based on functions, arrays, pointers, strings, structures and unions.

Problems:  https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice

**Thoughts:** 
I finished solving basic C programs I will move to coding websites from tomorrow.


### Day 10: January, 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved few problems on Codechef.

**Thoughts:** 
It's tough but have to stick with it.


### Day 11: January, 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved a lot of programs on HackerRank and got the Gold Badge in C . 
Started doing a course on DSA based on C/C++

**Thoughts:** 
I need to start learning a bit C++ because I would need it if I want to get into competitive Programming.



### Day 12: January, 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved few programs on SPOJ. They were really hard to solve. 

**Thoughts:** 
I guess I will practice few problems on CODECHEF first before switching back to SPOJ. SPOJ is a bit challenging.
