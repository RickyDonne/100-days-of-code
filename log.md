# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December, 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Planned everything for the next year.

**Thoughts:** 

I will cover these topics in the next 100 days: 

1. Data Structures and Algorithms (Coding part and problem solving)
2. System Design
3. Operating System and DBMS (database management system)
4. Object-Oriented Design
5. Cultural Fit

I have also joined the Odin Project to build my foundation in Web Development.

And I have made a target to solve almost 400 - 500 coding problems on codechef or leetcode.

### Day 1: January, 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of singly linked list in C & started reading The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I learned to implement adding & deleting nodes at the 
start, end, nth position & also reverse them using iteration & recursion
in a singly linked list.
Read about robot tour optimization and selecting the right jobs.

### Day 2: January, 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Wrote the code for a singly linked list without looking anything up and implemented a way to not take head as a global variable

Singly Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/SinglyLinkedlist-referenceHead.c

Learned about 

Doubly Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/DoublyLinkedList.c

and 

Circular Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/circularLinkedList.c

**Thoughts:** 
I learned and understood the concepts of doubly and circular linked list and implemented adding, deleting, reversal and traversal of nodes.
It's getting hard to find resources of DS in C language since most are in C++, Java and I am thinking of learning C++.
Books such as Algo design by Skiena and CLRS are good but not DS focused.


### Day 3: January, 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Learned a bit of C++ from GeeksforGeeks.Link to CPP: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/fork-cpp/ . 

Did my first coding problem on SPOJ. Attended a quiz CDSE hosted by WebDevsIn and got 13 correct out of 20. Practiced Implementation of SLL, DLL and CLL.

**Thoughts:** 
I could not complete my implementation of CLL. I will try it again tommorow.
