# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December, 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Planned everything for the next year.

**Thoughts:** 

I will cover these topics in the next 100 days: 

1. Data Structures and Algorithms (Coding part and problem solving)
2. System Design
3. Operating System and DBMS (database management system)
4. Object-Oriented Design
5. Cultural Fit

I have also joined the Odin Project to build my foundation in Web Development.

And I have made a target to solve almost 400 - 500 coding problems on codechef or leetcode.

### Day 1: January, 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of singly linked list in C & started reading The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I learned to implement adding & deleting nodes at the 
start, end, nth position & also reverse them using iteration & recursion
in a singly linked list.
Read about robot tour optimization and selecting the right jobs.

Code: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/SinglyLinkedlist.c


### Day 2: January, 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Wrote the code for a singly linked list without looking anything up and implemented a way to not take head as a global variable

Singly Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/SinglyLinkedlist-referenceHead.c

Learned about 

Doubly Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/DoublyLinkedList.c

and 

Circular Linked List: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/DSA/circularLinkedList.c

**Thoughts:** 
I learned and understood the concepts of doubly and circular linked list and implemented adding, deleting, reversal and traversal of nodes.
It's getting hard to find resources of DS in C language since most are in C++, Java and I am thinking of learning C++.
Books such as Algo design by Skiena and CLRS are good but not DS focused.


### Day 3: January, 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Learned a bit of C++ from GeeksforGeeks.Link to CPP: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/fork-cpp/ . 

Did my first coding problem on SPOJ. Attended a quiz CDSE hosted by WebDevsIn and got 13 correct out of 20. Practiced Implementation of SLL, DLL and CLL.

**Thoughts:** 
I could not complete my implementation of CLL. I will try it again tommorow.

My practice Repo: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice/tree/main


### Day 4: January, 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Completed Introduction to C++, Flow Control, Functions, Arrays and strings.
Range based loops were interesting and new to me.
An example: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice/blob/main/arrayincpp.cpp

Solved 2 problems in Codechef using C.

**Thoughts:** 
I need to focus a bit more in C and C++. Before going in depth in DSA. I will be spending few more days with C and C++ before commiting my entire time to DSA. 


### Day 5: January, 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Revised some of the theory concepts of C from a course on Udemy. Solved one problem in codewars. 
Practiced implementaion of CLL.

My code on CLL: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice/blob/main/CLL.c

**Thoughts:** 
Doing an actual C course from Udemy helped me get more clear picture of few concepts. I will need few more days to complete the course.


### Day 6: January, 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Revised few theory concepts of C on arrays, functions and character strings.
Created a tic tac toe game using C code.
Code of Tic tac toe: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C .
Practiced implementation of SLL, CLL and DLL.

**Thoughts:** 
It was fun to make the tictactoe game. I also revised the concepts of arrays and strings in C. I think i might be able to start proper learning of
DSA in 2-3 days.


### Day 7: January, 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Completed learning about the theory concepts of C from a udemy course. Learned a lot about pointers, structures and file IO concepts and implemented them.

A code on structures: https://github.com/RickyDonne/C-Programs/blob/main/Arrays%20and%20pointers/structuresInC.c

**Thoughts:** 
It was great to learn the theory but now I should start practicing them and start problem solving.


### Day 8: January, 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved around 39 C programs starting from the basic.

Problems: https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice

**Thoughts:** 
I would need another day to complete soving basic problems. I would move to proper coding websites after that.



### Day 9: January, 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Practiced 34 C programs based on functions, arrays, pointers, strings, structures and unions.

Problems:  https://github.com/RickyDonne/Practice

**Thoughts:** 
I finished solving basic C programs I will move to coding websites from tomorrow.


### Day 10: January, 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved few problems on Codechef.

**Thoughts:** 
It's tough but have to stick with it.


### Day 11: January, 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved a lot of programs on HackerRank and got the Gold Badge in C . 
Started doing a course on DSA based on C/C++

**Thoughts:** 
I need to start learning a bit C++ because I would need it if I want to get into competitive Programming.



### Day 12: January, 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved few programs on SPOJ. They were really hard to solve. 

**Thoughts:** 
I guess I will practice few problems on CODECHEF first before switching back to SPOJ. SPOJ is a bit challenging.


### Day 13: January, 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved few more problems on CODECHEF. I am getting used to writing clean code and understanding the importance of reading and thinking about a problem first rather than writing code. 

**Thoughts:** 
Even after getting stuck in a problem it's just a matter of time to find the solution. If you think about a problem and try different ways to solve it you will eventually get to the solution.


### Day 14: January, 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved around 10 problem. The problems now not only focuses on the answer but also have a time limit.

**Thoughts:** 
I need to optimise my code and have to be careful when using too many loops or recursion as it takes more runtime.


### Day 15: January, 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved few more programming problems and focused more on optimizing the code and writing clean code. Also focused on dynamic programming.

**Thoughts:** 
I guess I am taking too long to solve problem. I have to focus harder.



### Day 16: January, 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Practiced few C programs. Revised the theories of structures, functions, classes, objects and constructor in C and C++.

**Thoughts:** 
I will start with the theory of DSA from tommorow.



### Day 17: January, 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Template classes in C++ then revised Time and space complexity. Also focused a bit on recursion. Practiced Tail and head recursion.


### Day 18: January, 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Learnt about tree, indirect and nested recursion. Practiced few problems based on recursion like the Tower Of Hanoi and Taylor series. Also created an account on Codeforces and will try to compete weekly in events.



### Day 19: January, 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Revised recursion that i learnt about yesterday. Then mapped down the algorithms i need to learn over the years and what to practice in future. Practiced problems on CPP on hackerrank. Started taking an udemy course on CPP.

**Thoughts:** 
I need to learn CPP thoroghly and it's implementation using STL. 



### Day 20: January, 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Couldn't do much today because of the packed schedule. But did few problems based on arrays using C++. 



### Day 21: January, 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Lately being busy with college but still trying my best to coding and learn with my pace.
Learnt about vectors in C++ and practiced problems on HackerRank. Pretty cool stuff, I am loving C++ more than C. 

**Thoughts:** 
Need to focus more.



### Day 22: January, 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Couldn't do much but Practiced problems on topics like statements, operators and controlling program flow in C++.

**Thoughts:** 

I need to complete the C++ course of udemy within 2 days

Solved few problems on characters, strings and functions in C++. 




### Day 24: January, 24th, 2021

### Day 27: January, 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Solved bit of basic problems on C and C++. Started reading about bit operators and solved few problems.

Thoughts:
Bit operators are so over-powered, I never thought these can alter data and values in such extent especially XOR.


### Day 28: January, 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Attended a contest on GFG based on C++ and scored 220 out of 245. Solved few problems on bit manipulation. Read a blog on classes and objects.
