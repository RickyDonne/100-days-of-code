# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December, 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Planned everything for the next year.

**Thoughts:** 

I will cover these topics in the next 100 days.
Data Structures and Algorithms (Coding part and problem solving)
System Design
Operating System and DBMS (database management system)
Object-Oriented Design
Cultural Fit

I have also joined the Odin Project to build my foundation in Web Development.
And I have made a target to solve almost 400 - 500 coding problems on codechef or leetcode.
